    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
                I have developed many hobbies, but here are few that I mostly enjoy;
                <br>Along with programming as one of my hobbies, my other interests include playing games, reading manga/watching anime, video editing/filmmaking, and, lastly, beatboxing.
                <br>Most of my hobbies seem to lack physical activity, but that's because these are the things I've grown into and truly love doing.
                <br>These hobbies are what I've heavily invested in, but I'm still looking forward to exploring more hobbies that will help shape who I am and my future!
